# Bike_Rental_Prediction_Project

## Problem Statement

In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. A bike rental company wants to understand and predict the number of bikes rented daily based on environmental and seasonal settings.

## Objective

The objective of this case is to predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning algorithm.

## Machine Learning Models Used
The following machine learning models were used to predict bike rental counts:

Random Forest 
Caret

## Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)

## Conclusion
The project successfully predicted bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings using machine learning algorithms. The Random Forest Regressor provided the most accurate predictions among the models tested.
